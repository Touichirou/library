# library

A small library app. Users are able to add a book's title, author, and number of pages. 
Users can also specify whether they have read the book. If all required fields are filled in,
a card will appear on the page with the information input by the user. An alert will be shown if
the user attempts to insert a duplicate book in the library. A "duplicate" is defined as a book where
all three of the title, author, and number of pages are exactly the same. This enables users to, for example
input two different versions of a book where only the page numbers are different.
